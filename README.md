# Remote-DNS-Attack

The objective of this project is to perform remote DNS cache poisoning attack, also called the Kaminsky DNS attack. 
DNS Pharming attacks manipulate this resolution process in various ways,with an intent to misdirect users to alternative destinations,which are malicious. The project focuses on a particular DNS Pharming attack technique,called DNS Cache Poisoning attack.  In this remote attack,packet snifÔ¨Ång is not possible, so the attack becomes much more challenging than the local DNS attack.

Victim (DNS Server) : 10.0.5.12
Attacker : 10.0.5.7
User : 10.0.5.11
